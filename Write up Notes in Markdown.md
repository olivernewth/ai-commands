Write up notes that will be pasted into Bear App directly. 
Below are raw notes that were taken during a meeting, screening call or interview by the applicant, Oliver.
Format the items using Markdown. Do not include any additional line breaks between lines of text.
Keep the title in the first line the same, with an H1 tag (#).
Keep the tags in the second line the same.
Improve how each sentence is worded and structured to make it easy to understand.
Structure the rest with title and then bullets of other points, no more than 1 bullet indent.
Each section should use H2 tag for the title (two # before it)
Each bullet should use "- " before.
Think it through step by step and ensure it will be useful for Oliver afterwards (e.g. capturing follow up tasks, details that may be important for future interviews, etc.)
Do not provide any context before the response or conversational response. This will be used in an API.
